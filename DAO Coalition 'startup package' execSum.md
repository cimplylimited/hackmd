# codeslaw hats proposal to Grants Committee

MetaFactory has designed hats for LexDAO. LexDAO's proceeds for the entire lifetime of the hat will go towards funding codeslaw public goods. 

Here are the hats: https://shop.metafactory.ai/products/codeslaw-hat

In our deal with MetaFactory, we took on all the risk of a minimum sales of 40 hats. In exchange, MetaFactory designed the hats, is selling them on their site and will fulfill purchase orders. 

We were supposed to send $580 before sales, but MetaFactory was kind enough to waive that requirement. We now only have to send $300 to MetaFactory's metafactory.eth address because of sales so far.

Codeslaw is a meme developed organically by LexDAO engineers as they worked. This collaboration with MetaFactory takes the meme and turns it into a 'headless' brand stakeholders within LexDAO and far beyond can use as a flag of shared values to rally behind.
