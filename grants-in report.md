## Sept-Oct, 2022

### summary

* grants are incredibly important source of revenue for LexDAO

  * a pro/con aspect of non-profit work in general

* since forming mid-year 2022, the dedicated grant writing "grants-in working group" 

  * has been instrumental in LexDAO receiving donations of **~$60000**
  * with costs so far of only **$3500**

* though more expensive than LexDAO's other recurring costs at the moment, the grants-in WG continues to be a high ROI replenishment fff by the Guild's treasury


### retroactive request [Nov 16, 2022]

At the beginning of September, I (bestape) was paid $3500 by LexDAO as the sole member of the grants-in WG.

* [ ] I, bestape, am seeking another $3500 from LexDAO's treasury, this time retroactively, for my work as the sole member of the October grants-in WG.

* [ ] I propose LexDAO continues to pay the grants-in WG retroactively after reviewing the grant-in WG's report in a LexDAO governance call.

### September

* participated in Panvala stamps pilot 

* participated in GR15, including a big marketing push throughout on various platforms

  * LexDAO along with complementary hopefuls spoke on each other's Twitter Spaces
  * https://lexdao.substack.com/p/aug-2022-newsletter
  * multiple @everyone drives on LexDAO Discord

* unfortunately, LexDAO was removed from *crypto advocacy* and *A16Z* rounds in the middle of GR15 so we didn't get nearly as much matching as in GR14

* however, we did negotiate a consultation with Gitcoin about how to reenter GR16's *crypto advocacy* and we continue to plead the case for LexDAO's exceptional *infra* public good superpowers

* moreover, at ~600 unique contributors GR15 had a x3  increase of unique contributors compared to GR14

  * grassroots momentum, brand, continues to scale

### October

* continued building relationship with enDAOment, learning more about 'fiscal sponsor'

* General Magic (Giveth subDAO) joined LexClinic as a complementary service partner

* consulted with Gitcoin and Alliance, determined spending our GR14 *crypto advocacy* grant on the DAO Coalition's Lummis-Gillibrand project would likely get us back into future Gitcoin *crypto advocacy* rounds

* consulted Gitcoin on

  * their decision not to run GR16
  * putting LexDAO in one of the limited rounds Gitcoin will run instead of GR16
  * LexDAO as a service provider for Gitcoin's protocol when it's ready

* Public Nouns joined LexClinic as a client
