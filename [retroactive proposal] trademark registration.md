# [retroactive proposal] trademark registration

Request to pay House DClark in LexClinic $850 for LexDAO trademark registration.

Work and costs are already done. So this is a retroactive request. 

* $250 in USTPO filing fees.

* $200 in student work (8 hours at $25/hour).

* $400 in lawyer work (2 hours at $200/hour; many pro bono hours not billed).

Details about work can be found at http://payhistory.lex.clinic on lines 17 (student) and 20 (lawyer). 

Though not included in this proposal, DClark is working on converting the lawyer work she did for this job into a syllabus!
